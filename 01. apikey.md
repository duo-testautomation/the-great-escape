# Good job escaping the DUO room by *mouse*!

Let's start escaping this room by *code*!

First lets go back to the room url, to get the starting state of the room, by refreshing the browser.
Then open devtools, when you escaped by mouse you have unlocked F12, so hit it and go to the network TAB.

# apikey
To keep track of your progress you have gotten an apikey the first time you start playing the room.
With every request the browser made, this apikey was used. So if you want to escape by code, you will need it.

Here is how you van find yours. First some quality of life tricks,
to make the requests that your browser makes to the api easier to find,
activate the `Fetch/XHR` filter, or just type `/session` in the filter input. 
Then refresh your browser.

Now you can see some requests that the browser had made. 
If you activated the `Fetch/XHR` filter you will see 4 requests. If you filtered by `/session` you will see 2.
Either way you will probably know which one you need to figure out your apikey.

The request starting with **create?** gets HTTP Status code 208, is used to get the apikey from the backend.
Then the room tries to get the status of this player by making another request to the api using the apikey as a query-parameter.

These 2 requests are needed by the browser, but not by the api. 
The api only wants the apikey. So once you have got the key, you can go unlock the secret ([sorry, couldn't resist](https://youtu.be/2wyv52Ahry0)). 
Meaning you don't need to take care of these request while trying to code your way out of the room.

Copy the apikey to your clipboard, or save it somewhere you can find it.
