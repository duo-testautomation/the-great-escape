# The Final Steps

Now that we have solved puzzles 1 and 2, we have enough knowledge to solve the final two puzzles.

> ### :computer: ***Puzzle 3 and 4***
> 
> Work on solving the final two puzzles. How you do this is completely up to you. However, we have one requirement: we would like you to write a test for puzzle 4 that checks whether the response contains the text `You have escaped!`.

# :checkered_flag: To the Finish Line

We have now automated the entire escape room. However, we still haven't escaped within the required 5 seconds. Don't panic, we're going to do it now. We have put everything into a collection, so we can execute all the requests we have stored in our collection at once.

Click on your collection. If everything is correct, you will see on the top right :arrow_forward: `Run`. If you click on this, you will enter the "Collection Runner". Click on `Run 'name of collection'` and watch the magic happen.

If you get error messages and still can't escape, review what's going wrong, fix it, and run the collection again.

If you have successfully escaped using a collection run, you have reached the end of the workshop. We hope you enjoyed it and found it interesting.
