# Welcome

Thank you for joining our workshop here at Testnet. And since this is a workshop, you will be
automating an API yourself. For more experienced people you can choose your own tool and solve the
puzzles at your own pace. For everyone that is less experienced in automated API-testing we suggest
that you will use Postman, where we will guide you a little more than everyone that uses another tool.

# Purpose

We hope that first of all you had fun escaping the _Stadskamer_ using the browser.
And we hope that you will learn something in how to use tools like Postman when API's are
involved. Learning something new can be hard and frustrating sometimes, that's where
come in the picture. So at anytime feel free to ask for help!

# The challenge
Once you escaped the room using the browser you can see your time at the scoreboard. 
But you will also see that there is one empty column right after your name.
The **Automate in 5 tijd:** column. 
This column will only show a time when you have successfully escaped from start to finish within 5 seconds.
You won't be able to do that using the browser, so you need automation for this to succeed. 
The api of the room is the way to go. 
You need to figure out which api requests are being done to solve te room.

# Postman
The main tool we will use for this workshop is **Postman**, if you want to know more of how to use this tool
please start here:

[--> Postman English](./postman/English/00.%20legend.md)

# Other tools
While we will guide you through the process of escaping the room via the API using Postman, that doesn't mean that
Postman is the only tool you can use. We also used other tools and programming languages to escape:
 - Cypress, mainly a tool for browser automation, but it also can handle api requests.
 - Playwright, mainly a tool for browser automation, but it also can handle api requests.
 - Python, an open source, easy to start with, programming language.
 - Rest Assured, a java library which specializes in 'Testing and validating REST services'

When you want to learn something other than Postman, please continue by clicking the link at the end of this page.
Keep in mind that the steps for any tool other than Postman is less extensive, but since a possible solution is given,
we are sure you can escape using either of these tools.
